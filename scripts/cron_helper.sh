Usage: $0 [OPTION]... COMMAND
Execute the given command in a way that works safely with cron. This should
typically be used inside of a cron job definition like so:
* * * * * $(which "$0") [OPTION]... COMMAND

Arguments:
  -c           Ensure that the job never exits non zero.
  -e EXITFILE  The exit file that will have a time stamp written to it if the
               job succeeds.
  -h           This help message.
  -i           Nice the job so that it doesn't over consume resources.
  -k LOCKFILE  The lock file to hold while the job is running.
  -l LOGFILE   The log file to write stdout and stderr too.
  -n NAME      The name of this cron job. Giving the cron job a name causes
               log lines to include it in the output, and automatically sets
               EXITFILE, LOCKFILE, and LOGFILE to some simple default values.
               
               EXITFILE will be set to /var/run/\$USER/NAME.exit if
               /var/run/\$USER exists, otherwise it will write to
               /var/tmp/\$USER/NAME.exit

               LOCKFILE will be set to /var/run/\$USER/NAME.lock if
               /var/run\$USER exists, otherwise it will write to
               /var/tmp/\$USER/NAME.lock

               LOGFILE will be set to /var/log/\$USER/NAME.log if
               /var/log/\$USER exists, otherwise it will write to
               /var/tmp/$USER/NAME.log
  -s           If set the script will sleep a random time between 0 and 60
               seconds before starting the command.
  -t           If set then the output from the script will be automatically
               timestamped when being written to the log file.

COMMAND is the command that should be executed.
